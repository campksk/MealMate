# MealMate

The motivation for creating this project is to develop a smart and user-friendly tool that allows users to make the most of the ingredients they have. By simply entering the available ingredients, the system can instantly suggest a variety of possible dishes. Additionally, it helps reduce food waste, which is a major contributing factor to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.
The problem arises from a common situation in daily life: “What should I eat today?” Many times, people already have ingredients but do not know what dishes they can prepare from them. This often leads to food waste, which is one of the contributing factors to global warming.

The importance of this project is to serve as a cooking companion that helps create new dishes, provides convenience in daily life, and also contributes to reducing factors that lead to global warming.
